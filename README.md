# Brick and Ball

Brick and Ball is an adaptation of the classic Black Berry game in which your objective is to destroy all the brick in the level by projecting the ball at them, a sufficient number of times. When all the blocks are destroyed, the level is complete. 

This version of the game also includes player profiles, leaderboards, multiples levels and custom background colours, all written in C++ using the cinder library.
