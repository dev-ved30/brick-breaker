  I would like to make a game called bricks breaker that we could play on old blackberry phones.

  The games starts with a ball on a moving platform and some original velocity.
  The ball will move on towards the wall of bricks above it. Each time the ball hits the 
  wall, it will do some damage and eventually break the wall. If the ball moves off
  the screen, the player loses a life.
  
  For the first week I would like to make a basic game that has bricks on the screen and balls. It should hit the bricks
  and change the directions and velocity accordingly. The walls must also take damage and change apperance.
  If the ball falls of below the screen, the player will lose a life.


  In the second week I would like to add more levels to the game. I would like to be able to read and create level designs 
    based on a text file input. I would also like to refine the mechanics and build better score keeping.


  In the third week I would like to add difficulty to the levels and a leaderboard with gamer 
profiles.

* how to set it up and run it

  /*
  For the first week, I want to build the ball, walls and platforms and draw them using cinder.
  In the next two weeks, I hope to add custom backgrounds, players profiles, leaderboards etc.
